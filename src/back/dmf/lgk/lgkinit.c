/**
**
**  Name: LGKINIT.C - LGK_initialize implementation
**
**  Description:
**	This module contains the code which implements LGK_initialize
**
**	    LGK_initialize() - initialize lgk control block
**
**  History:
**	Summer, 1992 (bryanp)
**	    Working on the new portable logging and locking system.
**	19-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Check memory version number when attaching.
**	22-oct-1992 (bryanp)
**	    Change LGLKDATA.MEM to lglkdata.mem.
**	23-Oct-1992 (daveb)
**	    name the semaphore too.
**	17-mar-1993 (rogerk)
**	    Moved lgd status values to lgdstat.h so that they are visible
**	    by callers of LGshow(LG_S_LGSTS).
**	26-apr-1993 (keving)
**	    Remove support for II_LGK_MEMORY_SIZE. If II_LG_MEMSIZE
**	    is not set then calculate memory size from PM values. 
**	24-may-1993 (bryanp)
**	    If the shared memory is the wrong version, don't install the
**	    at_exit handlers (the rundown routines won't be able to interpret
**	    the memory properly).
**	14-jul-93 (ed)
**	    replacing <dbms.h> by <gl.h> <sl.h> <iicommon.h> <dbdbms.h>
**	26-jul-1993 (andys)
**	    Correct some calls to ule_format.
**	26-jul-1993 (jnash)
**	    Add 'flag' param to LGK_initialize() lock the LGK data segment.
**	20-sep-1993 (bryanp)
**	    In addition to calling PCatexit, call (on VMS) sys$dclexh, since
**		there are some situations (image death and image rundown without
**		process rundown) which are caught neither by PCatexit (since
**		PCexit isn't run) nor by check-dead threads (since process
**		rundown never happened). This fixes a hole where an access-
**		violating ckpdb or auditdb command never got cleaned up.
**	31-jan-1994 (bryanp)
**	    Back out a few "features" which are proving countereffective:
**	    1) Don't bother checking mem_creator_pid to see if the previous
**		creator of the shared memory has died. This was an attempt to
**		gracefully re-use sticky shared memory following a system crash,
**		but it is suspected as being the culprit in a series of system
**		failures by re-initializing the shared memory at inopportune
**		times.
**	    2) Don't complain if the shared memory already exists but is of a
**		different size than you expected. Just go ahead and try to use
**		it anyway.
**	21-feb-1994 (bryanp)
**	    Reverse item (1) of the above 31-jan-1994 change and re-enable the
**		graceful re-use of shared memory. People weren't happy with
**		having to run ipcclean and csinstall all the time.
**	23-may-1994 (bryanp)
**	    On VMS, disable ^Y for LG/LK-aware processes. We don't want to allow
**		^Y because you might interrupt the process right in the middle
**		of an LG or LK operation, while holding the shared memory
**		semaphore, and this would then wedge the whole installation.
**      17-May-1994 (daveb) 59127
**          Attach lgk_mem semaphore if we're attaching to the segment.
**	30-jan-1995 (lawst01)
**	    Fix bug 61984
**	26-Apr-1995 (jenjo02)
**	    Combined CSi|n_semaphore functions calls into single
**	    CSw_semaphore call.
**      12-jun-1995 (canor01)
**          semaphore protect memory allocation (MCT)
**      13-jun-1995 (chech02)
**          Added LGK_misc_sem semaphore to protect LGK_base.    
**      03-jun-1996 (canor01)
**          New ME for operating-system threads does not need external
**          semaphores. Removed LGK_misc_sem which protected resources
**          updated only in single-threaded startup.
**	25-jun-96 (nick)
**	    Removed commented and ifdef'd out code added in change by lawst01
**	    above ( for which I'm adding a history entry as well !).
**	24-apr-1997 (nanpr01)
**	    Reinstate Bryanp's change. In the process of fixing bug 61984
**	    by Steve Lawrence and subsequent undo of Steve's fix by Nick
**	    Ireland on 25-jun-96 (nick) caused the if 0 code removed.
**	    Don't complain if the shared memory already exists but is of a
**	    different size than you expected. Just go ahead and try to use
**      05-aug-1997 (teresak)
**          Remove reference for VMS to exhdef.h being located in sys$library
**          as this is not a system header file but an Ingres header file
**          (located in jpt_clf_hdr).
**  12-Dec-97 (bonro01)
**      Added cleanup code for cross-process semaphores during
**      MEsmdestroy().
**	27-Mar-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Added test for crossed thread types, refuse connection
**	    to LGK memory with E_DMA811_LGK_MT_MISMATCH.
**	12-apr-2001 (devjo01)
**	    s103715 (Portable cluster support)
**      19-sep-2002 (devjo01)
**          If running NUMA clustered allocate memory out of local RAD.
**      23-Oct-2002 (hanch04)
**          Changed memory variables to use a SIZE_TYPE to allow
**          memory > 2 gig
**      14-Nov-2002 (hanch04)
**          When reading in II_LG_MEMSIZE in a LP64 server,  the conversion
**	    should be to an 8 byte long or SIZE_TYPE.
**	17-sep-2003 (abbjo03)
**	    Changes to use VMS headers provided by HP.
**      7-oct-2004 (thaju02)
**          Use SIZE_TYPE to allow memory pools > 2Gig.
**	05-oct-2005 (devjo01)
**	    Copy II_INSTALLATION value returned by NMgtAt, since
**	    VMS implementation returns a pointer to a shared
**	    static buffer which will be reused by the next caller
**	    to NMgtAt for an existing logical.  Since CXinitialize
**	    queries logicals, the installation code used by CX may
**	    be overwritten unless it is copied to a safe area.
**	15-May-2007 (toumi01)
**	    For supportability add process info to shared memory.
**	21-feb-2008 (joea)
**	    Correct system-level installation value of II_INSTALLATION.
**	09-Dec-2008 (jonj)
**	    SIR 120874: use new form uleFormat, CL_CLEAR_ERR.
**      20-Nov-2009 (maspa05) bug 122642
**          In order to synchronize creation of UUIDs across servers added
**          a semaphore and a 'last time' variable into LGK memory. 
**      14-Dec-2009 (maspa05) bug 122642
**          #ifdef out the above change for Windows. The rest of the change
**          does not apply to Windows so the variables aren't defined.
**      19-apr-2010 (maspa05) bug 123595
**          Changed ID_UUID_SEM_INIT for unix to use cross-process routine
**          CS_cp_synch_init, which requires a status parameter.
**      29-sep-2010 (joea)
**          In a cluster, give LGK_initialize a second chance to create
**          or attach to shared memory.

/*{
** Name: LGK_initialize()	-  initialize the lg/lk shared mem segment.
**
** Description:
**	This routine is called by the LGinitialize or LKinitialize routine.  IT
**	assumes that a previous caller has allocated the shared memory segment.
**
**	If it discovers that the shared memory segment has not yet been
**	initialized, it calls the LG and LK initialize-memory routines to do so.
**
** Inputs:
**	flag		- bit mask of:
**			  LOCK_LGK_MEMORY to lock the shared data segment
**			  LGK_IS_CSP if process is CSP process this node.
**
** Outputs:
**	sys_err		- place for system-specific error information.
**
**	Returns:
**	    OK	- success
**	    !OK - failure (CS*() routine failure, segment not mapped, ...)

**     18-aug-1998 (hweho01)
**          Reclaim the kernel resource if LG/LK shared memory segment is  
**          reinitialized. If the shared segment is re-used (the previous creator 
**          of the shared segment has died), the cross-process semaphores get 
**          initialized more than once at the same locations. That cause the
**          kernel resource leaks on DG/UX (OS release 4.11MU04). To fix the 
**          problem, CS_cp_sem_cleanup() is called to destroy all the 
**          semaphores before LG/LK shraed segment get recreated. 
**          CS_cp_sem_cleanup() is made dependent on xCL_NEED_SEM_CLEANUP and
**          OS_THREADS_USED, it returns immediately for most platforms.  
**	27-Mar-2000 (jenjo02)
**	    Added test for crossed thread types, refuse connection
**	    to LGK memory with E_DMA811_LGK_MT_MISMATCH.
**	18-apr-2001 (devjo01)
**	    s103715 (Portable cluster support)
**	    - Add CX mem requirement calculations.
**	    - Add LGK_IS_CSP flag to indicate that LGK memory is being
**	      initialized for a CSP process.

**	27-feb-2004 (devjo01)
**	    Rework allocation of CX shared memory to be compatible
**	    with race condition fix introduced for bug 110121.
**	29-Dec-2008 (jonj)
**	    If lgk_calculate_size() returns FAIL, the total memory
**	    needed exceeds MAX_SIZE_TYPE and we can't continue, but
**	    tell what we can about the needs of the various bits of

    ** Restructured to better handle all those ugly race conditions
    ** which are easily reproduced by running two scripts, one that
    ** continuously executes "lockstat" while the other is starting
    ** and stopping Ingres.
    **
    ** For example,
    **
    **		lockstat A	acquires and init's the memory
    **		RCP		attaches to "A" memory
    **		lockstat A	terminates normally
    **		lockstat B	attaches to "A" memory, sees that
    **				"A"s pid is no longer alive, and
    **				reinitializes the memory, much to
    **				the RCP's chagrin.
    ** or (more commonly)
    **
    **		lockstat A	acquires and begins to init the mem
    **		RCP		attaches to "A" memory which is
    **				still being zero-filled by lockstat,
    **				checks the version number (zero),
    **				and fails with a E_DMA434 mismatch.
    **
    ** The fix utilizes the mem_ext_sem to synchronize multiple
    ** processes; if the semaphore hasn't been initialized or
    ** if mem_version_no is zero, we'll wait one second and retry,
    ** up to 60 seconds before giving up. This gives the creating
    ** process time to complete initialization of the memory.
    **
    ** Up to LGK_MAX_PIDS are allowed to attach to the shared
    ** memory. When a process attaches it sets its PID in the
    ** first vacant slot in lgk_mem->mem_pid[]; if there are
    ** no vacant slots, the attach is refused. When the process
    ** terminates normally by calling LGK_rundown(), it zeroes
    ** its PID slot.
    **
    ** When attaching to an existing segment, we check if  
    ** there are any live processes still using the memory;
    ** if so, we can't destroy it (no matter who created it).
    ** If there are no live processes attached to the memory,
    ** we destroy and reallocate it (based on current config.dat
    ** settings).
