  The table_auto_structure indicates whether base table structure 
  will be heap or will be chosen based on constraints defined with
  the table.

  If the auto structure option is selected and there is at least one
  primary key, unique or foreign key constraint defined in the CREATE
  TABLE statement, the table will be created with base table structure
  BTREE on the constrained columns. If more than one constraint is
  defined, the base table structure will be based on a primary key 
  constraint before a unique constraint, and a unique constraint before
  a foreign key constraint.

  The default is OFF.
