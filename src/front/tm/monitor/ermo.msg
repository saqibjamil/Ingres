** Name:	ermo.msg -	Message file for class MO
**
** Description:
**	This file defines the messages for class MO.
**
** History:
**	12-aug-1987 (daver)
**		Created.
**	10-mar-1989 (kathryn)	- Print blank line before printing rowcount.
**	03-may-1989 (marian)
**		Changed the copyright banner so it now says 1989 instead of
**		1986.  F_MO0033_TM_login_banner.	
**	02-nov-1989 (sandyd)
**		Removed the redundant copyright message from F_MO0033.
**	07-nov-1989 (teresal)
**		Rewrote 'Query buffer full' F_MO000B message to be more
**		informative.  Bug #8049.
**	14-mar-1990 (teresal)
**		Added warning message for input query missing an ending quote.
**	29-aug-1990 (kathryn)
**		Changed E_MO003D Not to print CMS file_spec syntax. 
**		Changed writeout.c to check for this error and print this 
**		message on all platforms.
**	31-aug-1990 (kathryn)
**		Fixed above change to Add new error message rather change old
**		one.
**	09-nov-1990 (kathryn)
**		Added E_MO006F_P_FlagSyntax and E_MO0070_R_FlagSyntax
**	08-feb-1993 (rogerl)
**		Added E_MO0071_R_NoCmdLnPass
**	10-feb-1993 (rogerl)
**		Back out '08-feb-1993 (rogerl)'.  Not needed & message never
**		shipped.
**	13-jan-1993 (mgw)
**		Change INGRES to OpenINGRES in F_MO0033_TM_login_banner and
**		F_MO0034_INGRES_exit_message.
**      21-Mar-1995 (liibi01)
**              Bug 67115, modify the login message from terminal monitor.
**	31-may-1995 (harpa06)
**		Bug #68876 - Added an error message that will appear if the 
**		user is trying to invoke QUEL with a STAR database since STAR
**		is currently not supported by QUEL. This error message will no
**		longer be used once the STAR catalogs are supported.
**	23-aug-95 (emmag)
**		Changed OpenINGRES to OpenIngres.
**	23-apr-1998 (hanch04)
**		Changed OpenIngres to Ingres. 
**	27-apr-1999 (mcgem01)
**		The login and logout banners shouldn't have the product
**		name hardcoded within them.
**	07-jun-1999 (somsa01)
**		Modified the last change to take out the first "%s". The
**		files which use these banners will have to append the
**		product name to them before usage.
**      10-Apr-2003 (hanal04) Bug 109389 INGSRV 2041
**		Modified F_MO003C to E_MO003C so that it is included
**              in the slow mnx file and can be retrieved by IIUGerr().
**      31-aug-2004 (sheco02)
**          	X-integrate change 467391 to main.

/* 
** Explanation:
**	QUEL is not compatible with the current STAR catalogs. STAR is driven
**	entirely by SQL semantics.  The STAR portion of OPC takes the best
**	CO-tree and converts it into a QP containing SQL queries that are
**	forwarded to the DBMSs (Ingres and others) that actually own the tables
**	involved in the query.  QUEL and SQL have some differences that are not
**	easily smoothed over. 
**
**	This message will be in effect until the STAR catalogs are supported by
**	QUEL.
**
** System Status:
**
** User Action:
**	The user must use SQL to perform queries on a STAR database.
