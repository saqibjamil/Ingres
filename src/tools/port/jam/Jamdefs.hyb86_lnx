#  Name: Jamdefs.hyb86_lnx -- Variable definitions for hybrid capable
#	x86 or x86_64 Linux
#
#  Description:
#       Platform specific variable definitions for hybrid capable Linux.
#	This includes int_lnx, a64_lnx.  It can also be used for non-hybrid
#	x86 Linux builds, such as int_rpl, although a wrapper will have to
#	massage the resulting variables into non-hybrid form.
#
# History:
#   06-Oct-2004 (hanje04)
#	Define ICE_EXT=so
#	Add header
#   07-Jan-2005 (hanje04)
#	 Fix up for GA build
#   09-Mar-2005 (hanje04)
#	Make AMD64 Linux a reverse hybrid build. To revert to a regular build
#	unset VERS32
#   26-Sep-2005 (toumi01)
#	Added two new variables extension_config and platform_config.
#	extension_config is equal to config_string on most platforms.
#	platform_config is a GV_ENV value from gv.h in most cases.
#   19-Oct-2005 (hanje04)
#	Remove -fwritable-strings, not supported in gcc 4.0
#   31-May-2005 (hanje04)
#	NPTL is now the default Linux build
#   21-Sep-2006 (toumi01)
#	Define C++ like CXX to invoke g++ so that this file includes
#	all the settings needed to override the compiler version.
#   16-Oct-2006 (hanal04) Bug 116866
#       Add CCDEBUG to hold the compiler's debug flag. Used to ensure
#       NOOPTIM does not strip this when explicitly set.
#   21-Mar-2007 (hanje04)
#	SIR 117044
#	Define BUILD_GTK_GUI and BUILD_GTK_INST so they are correctly
#	built on this platform. They are now excluded by default.
#    04-Apr-2007 (hanje04)
#	SIR 117044
#	Correct variable name, BUILD_PACKMAN should be BUILD_GTK_GUI.
#    02-Oct-2007 (hanje04 for kschendel)
#	BUG 118162
#	Add -fno-omit-frame-pointer so that stack backtraces work.
#	See cshl.c (clf/cs_unix), CS_lnx_stack_dump for more info.
#        8-Oct-2007 (hanal04) Bug 119262
#           Added archive iimerge.a alternative to shared library server.
#    01-Feb-2008 (rapma01)
#       BUG 119858
#       Added linking to rtlib -lrt neccessary for using
#       clock_gettime routine.    
#       25-Jun-2008 (rajus01) SIR 120420, SD issue 116370
#           Added PAMLIB to resolve symbols defined in PAM library.
#    09-Sep-2008 (crogr01)
#       BUG 120876
#       Prevent the GUI installer from building on 64 bit Debian Linux and
#       derivatives.
#	19-Jun-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122138
#	    Make a common platform Jamdefs for hybrid-capable linux on
#	    x86 or x86_64.  Rework the hybridization scheme: this platform
#	    Jamdefs produces xxx32 and xxx64 definitions, which the caller
#	    selects along with BUILD_ARCH.
#	16-Jul-2009 (bonro01)
#	    These gcc 4.x updates where not intended to be submitted
#	    yet.  Remove -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fwrapv
#	17-Jul-2009 (kschendel)
#	    The Datallegro edit history wasn't supposed to be there either.
#	    Delete it.
#	11-Aug-2009 (kschendel) SIR 122318
#	    19-Jun edit broke large-file-awareness on 32-bit;  fix.
#	    Delete even more Datallegro stuff that isn't supposed to be
#	    in here (yet).
#	19-Nov-2009 (thich01)
#	    Add GEOS_LOC and GEOS64_LOC for geospatial library locations
#	11-Jan-2010 (bonro01)
#	    Replace -lgcc_s with -shared-libgcc in LDLIBMACH32.
#	    The RHEL4 gcc 32bit build environmnt does not have a 32bit shared
#	    lib called gcc_s, it is called gcc_s_32.  In order to support
#	    all RHEL releases we will use the gcc standard parameter of
#	    -shared-libgcc which supplies the correct version.
#	20-Feb-2010 (hanje04)
#	    SIR 123296
#	    Add support for LSB builds
#	24-Mar-2010 (hanje04)
#	    SIR 123296
#	    Add LDORIGIN for LSB builds. Probably not the final setting but it
#	    works for now
#	28-Mar-2010 (hanje04)
#	    SIR 123296
#	    Remove debug flags, should not have been submitted.
#	20-apr-2010 (stephenb)
#	    Add compile flag -march=i486, otherwise gcc assumes the antiquated
#	    386 architecture which does not contain support for atomic built-ins
#	10-may-2010 (stephenb)
#	    -march=i486 becomes -march=i586. support for 64-bit atomic built-ins
#	    only came in pentium architecture
#	3-Jul-2010 (warmerdam)
#	    Add PROJ_LOC and PROJ64_LOC for geospatial library locations
#	31-Aug-2010 (troal01)
#	    Added the PROJ/GEOS64_LOC to LDLIBMACH32
#	31-Aug-2010 (thich01)
#	    Add WITH_GEO for platforms where spatial is not supported.
#	31-Aug-2010 (troal01)
#	    Renamed PROJ64_LOC and GEOS64_LOC to PROJHB_LOC and GEOSHB_LOC
#	30-Sep-2010 (troal01)
#	    Removed Geospatial linker flags. These are now handled in IINEEDLIBS
